# stui
Simplified Terminal UI (Nim lang, ANSI)

This is my first app in Nim.

STUI is a drag&drop aware ANSI terminal UI.
It can Tile the screen vertically, Tiles can have relative "50%" or exact "100ch" width.
Controlls layout is automatically computed - from top to bottom, left to right.
Controlls can have relative or exact width / heigth.

Demo / test file is stui_test1.nim
